Summary of Research:  

1. Smart Greenhouse Optimization: 
   - Developed an AI-driven approach to optimize temperature and humidity in smart greenhouses.  
   - Compared Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm for efficiency.  

2. Cardiovascular Disease Detection:  
   - Used Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to detect heart diseases.  
   - Improved accuracy and performance in medical diagnostics.  

Both studies showcase expertise in AI, optimization, and machine learning, with applications in automation, data analysis, and real-time decision-making. I also worked on the power consumption measurement of East West University. Where the total electricity bill of the EWU data center was measured. Unfortunately, the paper was not ready for publish in time as the semester ended.
